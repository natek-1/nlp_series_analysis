something and hide..What?.I can get snacks?Goody-goody..Here I go..I’ll take Jiraiya..I leave the rest to you..It’s unfortunate…\\n Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiyaone of the Sannin..Naruto!.Your opponent is me..Earth Style!.Dark Swamp!.Dang it..I can’t completely sink themwith such a puny swamp..The drug is still working..But…with this the snakes can’t move..Ninja Art!.Poison Fog!.I’ll be up a creek ifI take even one breath..My leg tendons…!.I won’t be eaten twice…!No way!.Here I go..Ninja Art!.Needle Jizo!.Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well..Even if we both have handicapsyou won’t one-up me…\\n Give up now..It’s unfortunate…\\n Here I had respected youas a fellow Medical Ninja..Stop..Stay back!.Please hang on Lady Tsunade…\\n The Sannin name which Lord Orochimaruis also called will cry..My body’s heavy..To think you who wereonce called the village madness\\n would ferry around such a kidand struggle tirelessly for the village..You’ve really fallen haven’t you?.I have a keen eye to discern ability..And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes..It’s precisely for this reason…that I don’t need the Uchiha kid..It’s no fun raising a geniuswho’s good from the start..So you can’t leave him alone\\n because it’s like you’re lookingat your old self?.That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inheritedthe inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill..And that’s because Narutodoesn’t possess the Sharingan..Shinobi ability is about whether\\n one can use and masterall the Jutsu of the world..Ninja refers to onewho can use Ninjutsu..Shinobi ability is no such thing..You still don’t get it?.A Ninja…is one who endures..It’s a difference of opinion huh..I’ll teach you one thing..What’s most important for Shinobi ability…\\n isn’t the number of Jutsuone possesses..What’s important is…\\n The mettle…\\n not to give up..Enough already…you jerk!.The mettle to never give up…\\n He possesses that..Heh..I don’t know what Jutsu you learned\\n but you can’t hit me withsuch a large motion..No good..It won’t easily hit witha moving opponent..Owwee!.And the Chakra isn’tcompletely held yet…\\n It seems you got a cracked thigh bonein your left leg\\n from the battle with the snake..Well you can still move ifit’s just the bone..But it’s impossible now…\\n The lateral vastus musclein your right leg is totally cut off..What should I do…?.That Jutsu of mine uses both hands..If even one arm is taken out it’s over..Are you scared of me?.Do you want to run away from here?.Naruto as I recall\\n you whooped it up like thisduring the first Chunin Exam..Don’t mess with me..I won’t run away!.\"Don’t mess with me..I won’t run away.\".\"I’ll take it..Even if I’m a Genin for life…\"\\n \"I’ll become the Hokage at any costso it’s okay with me.\".\"I’m not scared.\".Can you…whoop it up in the same way now?.Unlike you…\\n I will be the heir to the Hokage nameno matter what!.– Hokage is my dream!– Hokage is my dream!.You’re not a kid anymoreso you should stop whooping it up…\\n Depending on the situation\\n when you want to give up and run awayyou should run away..Oh my… What’s with that look?.You’ll die!.If you diethere are no dreams or anything…\\n Do you want to die?.You’re still a Geninso you should run away on the battlefield..Don’t tell a man to run away..Kids think that everything is easy..That’s why they talk about foolish dreamslike nothing at all..That’s why they can’t give up..Jiraiya was it youwho taught him that Rasengan?.Are you acting like a teacher by teachinga Jutsu that can’t be learned?.Don’t give him false hopes..That’s why a moony kid starts jokingthat he’ll become the Hokage!.They chase after foolish dreams…and then die..If I have three daysI’ll master that Jutsu..Then let\\'s make a bet..Bastard!.As for me… I stand by my words..That’s…my Way of Ninja!.A bet?.I’ll give you one week..If you can master that Jutsu\\n I’ll acknowledge thatyou’ll be able to become the Hokage…\\n and give you this necklace..You should’ve juststayed out of this…\\n Why?.Why?!.Old Lady Tsunade…\\n You’re still going to get up?.Just like our wager\\n I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you..Shadow Clone Jutsu!.Shadow Clone won’t do anything now..Enough… Don’t protect me Naruto.Stop it!.I told you that you’d dieif you were obstinate like that right?.If you die there will be no dreamsno nothing..Just get out of the way..Run away..Humph… It’s okay..I…\\n I absolutely will not die…\\n until I become the Hokage!.This way I can hold on to you.Here I go!.It’s the same Chakra movementas before..No this is…different..I see..In order to gain a handfor suppressing Chakra\\n the Shadow Clone…\\n Compress Chakra and…\\n hold it completely..Wha--?!.I-It can’t be..Rasengan!.I believe your promiseits a true heart give me courage\\n Always I feel itthe precious time with you\\n On your still shoulder\\n I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow\\n The city lights are like pieces of stars\\n That hold us together\\n “Each one of us glows differently”\\n you say laughingly\\n but you look most dazzling\\n Like a comet\\n like the rainbow after the storm\\n You bring light into my heart\\n Being lost can be the answer\\n Let’s promise we won’t cheat\\n Uh... like a shooting starwe do go ahead..I never forget my ideal…\\n to develop the Village Hidden in the Leafand protect its people..The Hokages have sacrificedtheir lives for that dream..And nowI also will put my life on the line..From this momentI am the Fifth Hokage!.Next time: \"The Fifth Hokage!A Life on the Line!\"'"

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
